# Enabling Cost Explorer<a name="cost-explorer-signup"></a>

You can enable Cost Explorer for your account using this procedure\. After you enable Cost Explorer, AWS prepares the data about your costs for the current month and the last three months, and then calculates the forecast for the next three months\. The current month's data is available for viewing in about 24 hours\. The rest of your data takes a few days longer\. Cost Explorer updates your cost data at least once every 24 hours\.

**Note**  
By default you can launch Cost Explorer if your account is a member account in an organization\. The master account can, however, block your access\. For more information, see [Consolidated Billing for Organizations](consolidated-billing.md)\.

**Note**  
Signing up to receive the AWS Cost and Usage Report or the Detailed Billing Report does not automatically enable Cost Explorer\. You must still enable it by performing the following procedure\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/home\#/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home)\.
