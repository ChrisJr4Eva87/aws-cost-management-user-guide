# Consolidated Billing in India<a name="useconsolidatedbilling-India"></a>

If you sign up for a new account and choose India for your contact address, your user agreement will be with Amazon Internet Services Pvt\. Ltd \(AISPL\), a local AWS seller in India\. AISPL will manage your billing, and your invoice total will be listed in rupees instead of in dollars\. Note that after you create an account with AISPL, you can't change the country in your contact information\.

If you have an existing account with an India address, your account is either with AWS or AISPL, depending on when you opened the account\. To learn whether your account is with AWS or AISPL, see the procedure [ Determining Which Company Your Account is With](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-account-payment-aispl.html#determine-seller)\. If you are an existing AWS customer, you can continue to use your AWS account\. You also can choose to have both an AWS account and an AISPL account, although they can't be consolidated into the same organization\. \(Currently, you can't migrate an existing account from AWS to AISPL\.\)

If you create an organization from a master account that is with AISPL, then you can invite only other AISPL accounts to join your organization\. You can't invite AWS accounts\.
