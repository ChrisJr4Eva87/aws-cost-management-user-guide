# Using the AWS Price List Service<a name="price-changes"></a>

The Price List Service API and AWS Price List API enable you to query for the prices of AWS services using either JSON \(with the Price List Service API\) or HTML \(with the AWS Price List API\)\. You can also subscribe to Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) notifications to get alertswhen prices for the services change\. AWS prices change periodically, such as when AWS cuts prices, when new instance types are launched, or when new services are introduced\.
